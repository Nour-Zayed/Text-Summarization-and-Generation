# Text Generation & Summarization App 🚀
An interactive AI-powered web app built with Streamlit, leveraging Hugging Face Transformers to perform two powerful NLP tasks:

## Text Generation ✏️

Powered by **DistilGPT-2** for creative, coherent text generation based on a user prompt.

Supports customization of output length, randomness (temperature), and sampling strategy (top-p).

Great for content creation, idea brainstorming, and generating completely new text.

## Text Summarization 📄

Uses **BART-Large-CNN** to condense long texts while retaining the most important information.

Ideal for summarizing articles, news, or large documents in seconds.

## Features 💡
Clean, user-friendly Streamlit interface.

Choose between Text Generation or Summarization with a single click.

Works locally or can be deployed online using Ngrok.

Easily customizable — swap models or tweak parameters to fit your needs.
